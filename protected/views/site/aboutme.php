        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>My name is Zane Moser and I'm a final-year Software Engineering and Finance student at the University of Auckland with a passion for analysing and trading financial markets. I began trading 5 years ago with a keen interest in foreign exchange however I have since expanded into other products such as global equities, precious metals and financial derivatives. In 2011 and 2012 I won the CMC Markets National Trading Challenge with 1-month returns of 650.2% and 505.4% respectively, along with teammate Ayrton Oliver. During my 2011 summer holidays I worked at UBS Sydney, house of the largest trading floor in the southern hemisphere where I gained an insight into institutional trading. From there I went on to work on the Equities Sales & Trading desk at UBS Auckland where I learnt a lot about what drives the NZ market.</p>
