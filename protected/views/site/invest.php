    <h1>WHY INVEST WITH US?</h1>
    <p>Our executive trader, Zane Moser, while still a student at the University of Auckland has 5 years trading experience and is on his way to completing one of the most versatile education programs out there: a double degree, Engineering (Hons) and Commerce specialising in software and finance. This unusual combination of skills gives our team a fresh approach to financial markets that may not be available other more traditional investment funds.</p>
    <p>We take our business seriously and can assure that your money will be safe. At any point in time feel free to request a complete record of financial transactions. We promote honesty through transparency.</p>
    <h1>ALPHA FUND</h1>
    <p>Our Alpha Fund is the sole focus of our traders at MCM. We use an adapted event-driven strategy that aims to capitalise on statistically favourable market mispricing. The complexity is left to our traders so all that you have to do is choose your desired level of risk. Remember, a higher risk tolerance means that your profits will be larger but so will any losses incurred.</p>
    <p>Because we are relatively new we have no official past performance statistics to display, however an investment trial was run by our head trader Zane Moser in the third quarter of 2012. Below are his results.</p>
    <h5>2012 INVESTMENT TRIAL</h5>
    <img src="/images/alpha_chart.png" alt="Moser Capital Alpha Fund Chart"/>
    <p>There are a few main conclusions to be drawn from these results, the first being that this trial only involved a small amount of capital ($1000). Our Alpha Fund will launch in March 2013 with between 50k and 100k under management and we foresee no reduction in performance due to the increased size of the fund.</p>
    <p>The second main conclusion that can be drawn is the high absolute return generated in this period. Peaking at 400% before residing at 200% return on investment, this may be what some investors dream of. Being an event-driven fund we aim to capitalise on market events and we successfully did so on the quantitative easing announcements in the US in September 2012. We cannot however guarantee such favourable trading stimulus in the future so these results cannot be used to accurately forecast future returns.</p>
    <p>Also not to be overlooked is the relatively large maximum drawdown of 62.5%. This occurred during trials of variant strategies that proved themselves unfavourable. We aim to reduce future drawdown with tighter risk controls.</p>
    <h1>PERSONAL INVESTMENT PLAN</h1>
    <p>If you decide that our Alpha Fund is not suitable for your investment, we can meet with you to discuss alternate investment strategies such as balanced market portfolios. In this way you can more comfortably control your exposure to the uncertainty of financial markets.</p>
